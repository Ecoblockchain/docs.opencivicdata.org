Open Civic Data
===============

The `opencivicdata <https://github.com/opencivicdata/>`_ organization on Github is the home to a collaborative effort to define common schemas and provide tools for gathering information on government organizations, people, legislation, and events.

If you're looking to contribute to the project or learn how to use the data, you're in the right place.

.. warning::
    Parts of Open Civic Data underwent a large refactor as of mid-2014, some information on this
    page may be out of date.   We're working on updating this documentation as soon as possible.

    We'll remove these messages from pages as they're updated and vetted.
