Contributing a Municipal Person Scraper
=======================================

This document is meant to provide a tutorial-like overview of the steps toward contributing a munipal Person scraper to the Open Civic Data project.

This guide assumes you have a working pupa setup. If you don't please refer to the introduction on :ref:`intro`.


Creating a New Person scraper
-----------------------------

Great. So, let's get started. Our person scraper can be located anywhere, and simply needs to be importable by the :file:`__init__.py` so that we can reference it in the `get_scraper` method. Your scraper can even by located in the :file:`__init__.py` file itself if you want to keep things extra simple, but scraper code can eventually get pretty lengthy, so its more scalable to break each scraper out into it's own file. Now open up the default :file:`people.py` scraper generated by the :program:`pupa` init program. It should look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../pupa/example/people.py
