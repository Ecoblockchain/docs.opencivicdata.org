Anthropod
=========


Welcome! This documentation is about a tool that we call
`Anthropod <https://github.com/opencivicdata/anthropod>`_.
Anthropod is a user-friendly interface to allow activists to manually
curate data regarding Legislative bodies.

This lets interested contributors collect data and curate the data when
it would be too painful to write (and maintain!) a scraper. Often times the
data that we collect doesn't change enough (or there isn't enough of it)
to make the time spent writing a scraper worth the effort.

This is where Anthropod comes in. Using anthropod, you can output data in the
same format as the scrapers output, or even manually augment or correct
the data that the scrapers pulled in.

Why use Anthropod?
------------------

Anthropod is just another means of collecting data. When data is really hard
to continually scrape and update, it makes sense to spend the man-hours
that would have gone to developing a scraper on manually collecting the data
instead.

It's also a great way for non-developers to contribute to the OpenCivic
data project without knowing how to program. Manual data collection is always
needed, and can really help when research needs to be done into the exact
situation.

OK. I'm onboard. What next?

Great, let's jump right in:
