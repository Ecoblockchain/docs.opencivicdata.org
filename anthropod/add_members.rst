To add a new membership to the organization, click the "add another" button. A membership is essentially a connection between a person and a organization post, so the app will prompt you to create a new person or choose an existing person to use for the membership.

To add a new person who will be a member of an organization, click the button to create a new member. Fill in the person's details in the form (shown below). Finally, use the drop-down box to choose the appropriate "post id" for this membership. The post id will usually be the electoral district this person respresents, or "at large" if the person is an at large member who doesn't represent a specific district.

At this point, all the required fields have been supplied, so we can save the person and move on. But adding contact information for the person is both easy and worth the effort, so let's do that too.

Enter the Person's Contact Details
------------------------------------------------

Adding contact information is very straightforwarded: for each field, you select a field type, a value, and optionally add a note. This allows you to add multiple phone numbers, for example.

Optionally Enter External Links
----------------------------------

What might go in the external links boxes at the bottom of the form? Twitter addresses, person websites, like www.2shay_rep.biz (no, that's not a real website), facebook accounts, and the like. It depends how like the NSA you want to be while you're collecting data.
